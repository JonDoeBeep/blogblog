# Websites 101
Do you have a company? A side hustle? Anything, really, that you'd like to share with the wider world? If you have something worth sharing, a website can help anyone find it. 

Most people think that to make a website that doesn't look half bad, you need to do complex coding and development while using intimidating things like color theory and design. In reality however, it's significantly simpler. Using no code at all, I'll teach you how to make a simple, beautiful website that can fit your needs in under a day.

## The Grocery List.

To do this, you'll need a few (free) tools. 

* Wix. 
  Their website designer is free, easy, and smooth.

* A Domain (Optional).
  To stand out, you need your own domain name. Sounds confusing? It's really not. That's just the **URL** of your site. Think "google.com" or "youtube.com."

* An Idea.
  You shouldn't just go in blind. Think of what you want.

That's all you need to make your own, fully-fledged website.

## Step 0: What Exactly Are We Doing?

When designing a website, you need a plan. For a website to be good, it needs to be focused (at least generally). Answer the question "What exactly are we doing?" in this step. 

For example, I'm a photographer. Say my answer to that question is "I help local buisnesses with clean product shots." That's my website then. I should focus on that, specifically, because that's why people will be coming to my website. 

## Step 1: The Begining.

First, navigate to Wix.com and create an account. Navigate to sites, a page that looks like this.

Next, create a site, and choose the site matching your last question best. It should look like *this*.

Finally, navigate to templates, and choose the template that calls to you the most.

For this tutorial, I'll choose the pastel creative one for portfolios. You may choose another one.

Now that we've got what we want and need exactly, we can move on.

## Step 2: Structure, Simply.

Structure is incredibly important to websites, yet it oft goes unnoticed. Sites like [apple](https://www.apple.com/) use structure to draw users directly into their products, and how to buy them. Sites like [google](https://www.google.com/) direct the user immediately to the search bar. This isn't by accident.

In general, you'll want 3 *essential* parts:

* The Header

* The Body

* The Footer.

The header shouldn't draw user's attention too much. It should contain naigation, and a headline.

The body is where most of the content will lie. This is what you want the user to see immediately, interact with, and more. It's the main portion of the website, and the most important. Focus on this portion specifically.

The footer is the last part the user will see, and the least important. It's optional, but in general, it'll include contact info, directories, and little more.

This is an example of the structure of the body of our chosen portfolio. We see its divided into two portions, an example, and the portion the user will interact with. By centering both and dividing them clearly, we essentially create two portions the eye will naturally look to as the page first loads. Since its a portfolio, we place our work front and center, along with how to see more. Then above and below, we place our short bio and contact info. By positioning these elements strategically, we create an order of importance in the user's mind, and improve the flow and feel of the website without even doing anything.

## Step 3: Text, Fonts, and Colors.

## Step 4: Videos, Images, and Other Media.

## Step 5: Publishing.
