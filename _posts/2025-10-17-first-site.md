Do you have a company? A side hustle? Anything, really, that you'd like to share with the wider world? If you have something worth sharing, a website can help anyone find it.

Most people think that to make a website that doesn't look half bad, you need to learn how to do complex coding and development, and learn intimidating things like color theory and design. In reality, it's significantly simpler. Using no code at all, I'll teach you how to make a simple, beautiful website that can fit your needs in under a day.

## The Grocery List.

To do this, however, you'll need a few (free) tools. 

* Wix. 
  Their website designer is free, easy, and smooth.

* A Domain (Optional).
  To stand out, you need your own domain name. Sounds confusing? It's really not. That's just the **URL** of your site. Think "google.com" or "youtube.com."

* An Idea.
  You shouldn't just go in blind. Think of what you want.

That's it. That's all you need to make your own, fully fledged website.

## Step 1: What Exactly Are We Doing?

When designing a website, you need a plan. For a website to be good, it needs to be focused, at least generally. Answer the question "What exactly are we doing?" 

For example, I'm a photographer. Say my answer to that question is, "I help local buisnesses with clean product shots." That's my website then. I should focus on that, specifically, because that's why people will be coming to my website.
